Built a responsive BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to enter their weight and height to calculate BMI and provides health category feedback (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).
Leveraged JavaScript for real-time calculations and input validation, and designed an intuitive, visually appealing interface with CSS. 
Strengthened front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, form handling, and styling for a seamless user experience.
